![Badge Workflow](https://github.com/san99tiago/aws-cdk-organizations-demo/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/badge.svg)

DEMO for the best practices of AWS Organizations with Infrastructure as Code on CDK-Python.

## TODO:

Add a detailed README with diagrams, explanations and examples of usage.

## CI/CD and Deployment ðŸš€

The deployment process is intended to run with GitHub Actions Workflows.

- On `feature/****` branches commits, the CDK project gets **synthesized** and it shows the **state diff** between the current AWS resources and the expected ones.

- When merged to `main` branch, it will get deployed to the AWS Account automatically.

To understand the AWS Credentials usage, please refer to the [`prerequisites/README.md`](.github/prerequisites/README.md).

## Special thanks :gift:

- Thanks to all contributors of the great OpenSource projects that I am using. <br>
